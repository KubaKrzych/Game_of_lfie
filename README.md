# Game_of_lfie
Visualization of John Conway's Game of life using Python.

## What is a so called _Game of life_?

You can read about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). The whole concept is fairly easy to implement once you know how the algorithm works.

## How it works?

To make this thing work, all you need to do is download the files and run `main.py`. This will open up terminal, and ask you for both `Width` and `Length`. These two variables set the size of the screen on which the visualization will take place.  

In the upper left corner you can see the `generation` of current cells.

## About

This was my first "bigger" project. I tried to get to know both `pygame` library  and `numpy`, as I was told that I will be using these a lot in a not so distant future. The whole concept is very easy to implement using only built in Python functions and syntax, but I wanted to use let's say _more advanced_ Python, for example OOP - this was my first project and implementation of OOP.
